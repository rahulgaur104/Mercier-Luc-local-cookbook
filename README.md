# Mercier-Luc-local-cookbook
Local equilibrium-to-GS2 interface

This script creates a local Miller equilibrium for Tokamaks and generates all the required data needed for a gyrokinetic calculation with GS2.
There is also a provision to do a ballooning stability analysis and plot the $s-\alpha$ curve.
