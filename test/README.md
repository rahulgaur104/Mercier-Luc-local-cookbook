## Description
This directory contains a manual test to compare the geometric coefficients from GX with the geometric coefficients generated by local_eikcoefs_gen_norm.py.

* Relevant files: ./output_grid_files/gx_out*.nc, gs2_test_input.out.nc, grid_test_GS2_new.py

* gs2_test_input.out.nc is the output file from GS2 whereas ./output_grid_files/gx_out*.nc is the output file from the local eikcoefs_gen_norm.py script. 

* grid_save_GS2_new.py compares gs2_test_input.out.nc with gx_out_*.nc
