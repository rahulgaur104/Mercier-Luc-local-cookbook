## Description
This directory contains a manual test to compare the geometric coefficients from GS2 with the geometric coefficients generated by local_eikcoefs_gen.py.

Relevant files: eik5.out, eik6.out, gs2_test_input.out.nc, grid_test.py, grid_test_new.py

eik5.out and eik6.out are the output files from an old version of GS2 whereas gs2_test_input.out.nc is the output file from the new version. 

grid.GS2_out_Miller_idx... is the output file from the local eikcoefs gen script. 

grid_save.py compares eik5.out and eik6.out with grid.GS2_out_Miller_idx whereas grid_save_new.py compares gs2_test_input.out.nc with grid.GS2_out_Miller_idx
