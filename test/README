This directory contains a manual test to compare the geometric coefficients from GS2 with the geometric coefficients generated by local_eikcoefs_gen.py.

eik5.out and eik6.out are the output files from an old version of GS2 whereas gs2_test_input.out.nc is the output file from the new version. 

grid.GS2_out_Miller_idx... is the output file from the local eikcoefs gen script. 

grid_save.py compares eik5.out and eik6.out with grid.GS2_out_Miller_idx whereas grid_save_2.py compares gs2_test_input.out.nc with grid.GS2_out_Miller_idx
